# CS50-AI
This is chapter one of my quest to master AI programming in Python. It is set in the island of CS50 Courses, birthplace of many a young aspiring programmer. This repository documents my learning process, as I tackle seven formidable creatures that dwell there: Search, Knowledge, Uncertainty, Optimization, Learning, Neural Networks, and Language.

While the course provides two project challenges for each theme, I will only include my attempt at one per theme in this repository. I will use the others as sandboxes to get a grip of the techniques before I tackle the projects I chose to display here.

This is also the first time I interact with Git and GitHub, so I apologize for any lack of clarity in the way I display my code and notes here.

My strategy to display the learning process, for each theme project, will be to:
  1) Write a first attempt that at least produces the desired effect. Here I will use minimal assistance from GPT4 only to find the causes of errors I don't understand on my own, and no assistance at all in terms of making the code concise, memory-efficient, python-esque, etc.
  2) Commit this first attempt to the main branch.
  3) Create a branch that will be used to perfect the code.
  4) Document the changes and what I learned in Pull Requests from that branch.

Here goes.
